This is my implementation of a genetic algorithm for Codingame Summer Challenge 2024.
Different versions of the algorithm test different options regarding :
 - size of population
 - mutation rate of the population
 - evaluation function for each solution
 - individuals in the initial population (perfect runner, perfect diver)
